# C Concept Implementation
This repository contains some of the concepts which I practiced and some questions like parsing a string for checking grammer, unique total colours, etc. 
C was the first language which I learned, which made me understand basic concepts of programming and how it works.
Currently, I know over 7 languages C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, GoLang, JavaScript, TypeScript and the base for all was set up by 'C' language.
